**Background**

This project will develop a Machine Learning algorithm to predict if a bank's customer will subscribe to their term deposit offer or not. The prediction model will use the dataset coming from their call center data and the objective of the prediction model is to find ways to improve the success rate of calls made to the customer for any product offered to them. 

**Solution**

The solution of this requirement will be a predictive model (Random Forest, or XGBoost) based on the data available in the call center dataset for 40,000 calls made to the customers. Before model development, Exploratorty Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed to handle missing/NULL values and OUTLIERS. 

Since this data also contains categorical variables, so ONE-HOT ENCODING will be used to assign an order to the categorical variables and to find OUTLIERS for these categorical variables. The concepts of 'Bins' will also be used to handle the continuous numerical variables.
